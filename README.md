# Random-Walk-Metropolis-IWLS
R Programming statistical computing script which calculate a random walk metropolis hasting acccording to a sample size and a phi of a proposal function by matching those ones who have an acceptance probability. Iterative weighted least squares function was added too in order to find the likelihood estimations of a range of X by input a file. 

The Metropolis Hastings algorithm is a beautifully simple algorithm for producing samples from distributions that may otherwise be difficult to sample from.

Using the function rwmet you will be able to create your own examples. Feel free to modify theta(proposal function), M = sample size and phi.

The iterative weighted least squares algorithm calculates the likelihood of a range of x.

Use the iwls function with an iteration of 25 until it converges.
